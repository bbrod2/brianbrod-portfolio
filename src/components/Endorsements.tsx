    text: `I would like to use this channel to recognize Brian for his quality level of effort, tenacity, and perseverance by doing a break fix on one of our APIs related to latency in a short period of time and in the process also resolving one of the toughest code vulnerabilities we have had so far in the same section of the code. He replaced a problematic library with native Java code, eliminating the issue entirely, all while pulling a 12-hour workday. I am really fortunate to work with such a smart, hard-working, and tenacious team member with a great attitude who makes our entire team more successful. Thank you Brian!`
